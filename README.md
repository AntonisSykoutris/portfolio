# My Portfolio Site

https://antonissykoutris.github.io/portfolio/

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following - 

## Semantic HTML
I used sematic HTML because it makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.

## BEM methodology 
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable


## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.



## Github Pages
Once the website was finished and it was ready for deployment I hosted it using github pages.
## Quality of my Web page

I used Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for measuring the quality of web pages.
